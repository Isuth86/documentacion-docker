# Introduction

In this project, we will work with a set of technologies that allow for agile and efficient deployment of web services and container management.

## LAMP Stack + WordPress

The **LAMP** environment is an acronym describing an internet infrastructure system that uses the following tools:

*   **L**inux: The operating system. In our case, we use an **Ubuntu 22.04** image.
*   **A**pache: The web server.
*   **M**ySQL / **M**ariaDB: The database management system.
*   **P**HP: The programming language for dynamic processing.

On this technology stack, we will install **WordPress**, the most popular CMS (Content Management System) in the world.

## Docker and Portainer

**Docker** allows us to package applications and their dependencies into virtual "containers" that run on any Linux system. This facilitates deployment and ensures that software works the same everywhere.

**Portainer CE** is a lightweight management tool that offers a simple graphical interface to manage Docker environments. It allows managing containers, images, networks, and volumes without needing to use the command line for everything.

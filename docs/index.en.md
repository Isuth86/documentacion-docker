# Docker Services Documentation

Welcome to the technical documentation for the Operating Systems Administration project.

## Project Objective

This project aims to document the deployment and configuration of essential services using **Docker**. Specifically, two practical cases are covered:

1.  **LAMP + WordPress**: Creation of a complete web server environment (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) to host a WordPress site in a single container.
2.  **WordPress + MariaDB (Separate Containers)**: Modular deployment using a Docker network to connect an application container and a database container.
3.  **Portainer CE**: Implementation of a graphical interface to manage Docker containers efficiently.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

*   **Introduction**: Overview of the technologies used.
*   **Installation & Requirements**: Detailed steps to install and configure containers and services.
*   **Usage & Operation**: Guide on how to access and use the deployed services.
*   **Conclusions**: Summary of learning and possible improvements.
